She had everything she could ever want in the tower, but she was bored and lonely. One day, a handsome prince came riding by on his horse and saw the princess in the tower. He fell in love with her and decided to rescue her. He climbed up the tower and took her away to his castle. They lived happily ever after and had many beautiful children together.\n"
